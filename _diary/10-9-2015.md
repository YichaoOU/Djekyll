[1:45 PM]
I came to lat at 12 pm. They found I wore my shirt indise out, common to PHD, right?
Welch called rami and discussed my stress-responsive slides, I was asked to do several things. 
I then helped Marilyn about TOMTOM and Veronica's pathway analysis pipeline.
Now I'm eating tomatoes for freshing!

[4 PM]
I became unhappy. Probabily because hangray and can't get any good solution to the things on stress-responsive genes.
