In computer science, kernels or [kernelization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernelization) often refers to the pre-processing of input so as to design more efficient algorithms. Such as kernelization for vertex cover problem.
In machine learning or data mining, [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) or kernelization or kernel tricks or kerel subsitution often refer to the mapping to higher dimension of the feature space. 'Scalar' and 'subsitution' are the keywords here. Such as support vector machine and kernel k-means. 
In mathematics, kernel refers to a function.
