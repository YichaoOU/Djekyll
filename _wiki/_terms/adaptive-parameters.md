Adaptive parameters are the parameters we try to solve. Initially, we don't know the parameters. We may need some optimization methods to get the parameters. They are called 'Adaptive' probabily because the term [Adaptive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control). These parameters control our system/model, and thus we want to tune them in order to let it perform well.
